#Python is a dynamically typed language meaning you can assign a variable as a specific type, and then reassign it as
# a different one later
my_age = 5
print(type(my_age))

my_age = "5"
print(type(my_age))

#In almost all instances though, its bad to change the type of a variable. Instead you should just make a new one
speed = 5
speed_description = "5"

#Languages that arent dynamically typed such as Python or Javascript are statically typed such as GO or Typescript. This 
#means a type error occurs when a variable is attempted to be assigned a new type. 


#The only benefit dynamically typed languages had over statically typed ones in the past was the benefit of simpler syntax
#allowing you to wrtie code more quickly. Nowadays though dynamically typed languages are overall just superior though
#Through type inference dynamically typed languages no longer have to utilize verbose syntax, it can be just as simple as
#with dynamically typed languages.
