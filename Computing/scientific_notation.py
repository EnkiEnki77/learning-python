# Scientific notation is a way of expressing numbers that would be cumbersome to fully write out. 

# To add 0's to a number we write e and then the number of 0's we'd like.

num1 = 16e3 # 16,000.0
print(num1)

# To add 0's ahead of a number we do the same as above but the number of 0's will be negative

num2 = 16e-3 # 16,000.0
print(num2)

num3 = 0.7e-3 # 16,000.0
print(num3)

# e and then a positive number moves a number forward in decimal places, a negative number moves it back decimal places. 


# Python also allows you to write numbers with an underscore as the delimiter for readability 

num4 = 16_000_000
